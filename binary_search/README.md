This project shows the differences between iterative search and binary search.

Since naive search iterates over the whole list, it executes in O(N), meaning its execution grows linearly.

Binary search cuts the amount of items being searched in half each iteration, meaning it executes in O(log(N)), making it much more efficient as data sets grow.
